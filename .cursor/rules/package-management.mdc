# Package Management

## Package Manager
- Use **pnpm** exclusively (configured in [package.json](mdc:package.json) via Volta)
- Never use `npm` or `yarn` commands
- Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` to ensure consistent installs

## Node.js Version
- Use Node.js 22.17.1 as specified in Volta configuration
- Use pnpm 10.13.1 as specified in Volta configuration

## Dependencies
- Keep Mastra dependencies updated together (`@mastra/*`)
- Use specific versions for AI SDK packages
- Group related dependencies logically

## Scripts
- Add common development scripts to package.json
- Use `tsx` for TypeScript execution during development
- Leverage Zenn CLI for article management

## Environment
- Keep sensitive configuration in `.env` (not committed)
- Use environment variables for API keys and external service URLs
- Document required environment variables in README when needed
